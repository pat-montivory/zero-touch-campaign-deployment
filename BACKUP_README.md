## 🚀 How to Use This Backup

### Quick Deployment from Backup:
```bash
# Copy the entire deployed example to target location
sudo cp -r /home/azureuser/dev/zero-touch-campaign-deployment/deployed-example/* /var/www/campaignmanagerv12/

# Set permissions (if needed)
sudo chown -R azureuser:www-data /var/www/campaignmanagerv12
chmod +x /var/www/campaignmanagerv12/scripts/*.sh
